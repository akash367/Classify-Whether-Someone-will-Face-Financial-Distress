# Classify-Whether-Someone-will-Face-Financial-Distress
Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Project

Based on an individualâ€™s credit data, classify whether or not somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years.
Banks play a crucial role in market economies. They decide who can get finance and on what terms and can make or break investment decisions. For markets and society to function, individuals and companies need access to credit. 
Credit scoring algorithms make a guess at the chances of default. These are the method banks use to determine whether or not a loan should be granted. 
The purpose of building our model is to make it accessible to the borrowers, who can use the model to help make the best financial decisions.
